const tutorial5_slide2 = "Select a shooting mode that suits your needs and level of control. Common modes include Auto, Aperture Priority, and Manual. In Auto mode, the camera automatically adjusts settings for optimal exposure. This mode is great for beginners. In Aperture Priority mode, you control the aperture setting while the camera selects the appropriate shutter speed. It provides more creative control over depth of field. In Manual mode, you have full control over both aperture and shutter speed. This mode offers the most creative freedom."

const tutorial5_slide3 = "Depending on the shooting mode, you may need to set the exposure manually or let the camera adjust it automatically. Adjust the aperture, shutter speed, and ISO settings based on the available light and desired effect. Use a wider aperture (smaller f-number) for a shallow depth of field or a narrower aperture (larger f-number) for a larger depth of field. Ensure the shutter speed is fast enough to avoid camera shake or motion blur."
