const tutorial2_slide2 = "The distance between your subject and the camera affects the blur effect in your photographs. When shooting close to the subject, the background tends to blur more prominently, creating a pleasing separation between the subject and its surroundings. By increasing the distance between the subject and the camera, you reduce the blur effect and capture more of the surrounding scene in focus."

const tutorial2_slide3 = "Focal length is the measurement, in millimeters, that determines the field of view and magnification of your lens. A smaller focal length, such as 18mm, provides a wider field of view, perfect for capturing landscapes or group shots. A larger focal length, such as 200mm, narrows the field of view, allowing you to capture distant subjects with greater magnification."
const tutorial2_head3 = "Understanding Focal Length"


const tutorial2_slide4 = "To create a shallow depth of field with a blurred background, use a larger aperture (smaller f-number) and position yourself close to the subject. For landscapes or scenes where you want everything in focus, use a narrower aperture (larger f-number) and maintain an optimal distance from the subject. Experiment with different focal lengths and distances to achieve the desired effect in your photographs."

You now understand how focal length and distance impact your images, especially in relation to the blur effect and depth of field. Apply these techniques in practice to enhance your photography skills!"
