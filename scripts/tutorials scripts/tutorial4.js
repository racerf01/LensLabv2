const tutorial4_slide2 = "Light sources can vary in color temperature, intensity, and direction, which affect the overall look and feel of your photographs. Common light sources include natural light (sunlight), artificial light (incandescent, fluorescent, LED), and flash. Understanding different light sources allows you to adapt your camera settings for optimal exposure and achieve the desired mood in your images."
const tutorial4_head2 = "Understanding Light Sources"


const tutorial4_slide3 = "The Light panel controls the brightness of the area where the camera is. Each button changes the lighting in a different way. You can try pressing the buttons and see how it affects what you see in the viewfinder and the model."
const tutorial4_head3 = "Light Panel"


const tutorial4_slide4 = "The Light panel in the DSLR Camera Simulator allows you to adjust the lighting conditions for your simulated environment. Experiment with different light buttons to simulate various light sources and observe their impact on the scene."

const tutorial4_slide5 = "Start by selecting a light source button on the Light panel. Observe the changes in the scene and evaluate the exposure. Adjust the exposure settings (aperture, shutter speed, ISO) to achieve a well-exposed image for the specific light source."
const tutorial4_head5 = "Adjusting Exposure for Different Light Sources"


const tutorial4_slide6 = "Natural light from the sun changes throughout the day, affecting the color temperature and intensity. In bright sunlight, you may need to use a faster shutter speed and lower ISO to prevent overexposure. During golden hour or in low light conditions, a slower shutter speed and higher ISO may be necessary to maintain proper exposure."
const tutorial4_head6 = "Natural Light (Sunlight)"


const tutorial4_slide7 = "Artificial light sources have different color temperatures and may introduce color casts in your photographs. Use the white balance settings in your camera or post-processing software to adjust the color temperature and correct any color shifts. Experiment with different exposure settings to achieve the desired balance between the subject and the artificial light source."

const tutorial4_slide8 = "Congratulations! You have completed the Exploring Different Light Sources tutorial. You now understand how different light sources can impact your photographs and how to adjust the exposure settings using the light panel in the DSLR Camera Simulator. Apply this knowledge in practice to capture beautifully lit images in various lighting conditions!"

const tutorial4_slide9 =  "Remember, the best way to understand the impact of different light sources is through practice. Experiment with various lighting conditions and observe how they affect your images. Continuously refine your exposure settings to achieve the desired results. Enjoy the process of capturing stunning photographs in different lighting environments!"
